# thrustdb_benchmarks

This repo contains the BMK benchmarking tool and some scripts to run comparative benchmarks and then generate pretty graph files from them. See the setup_on_ubuntu-24.md and thread_pool_hybrid-vs-connection_per_thread-mysql_8.0.4-ubuntu_24.04-on-r5.8xlarge.md files. I don't expect this to work on any machine that isn't an Ubuntu 24.04, but I'm putting it out there any way. If you need help configuring this email me@damienkatz.com.
