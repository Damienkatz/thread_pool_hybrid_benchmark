# thrustdb_benchmarks

This repo contains the BMK benchmarking tool and some scripts to run comparitive benchmarks and then generate pretty graph files from them. See the example.md and example_run.md files. I don't expect this to work on any machine that isn't an Ubuntu 24.04, but I'm putting it out there any way. If you need help configuring this email me@damienkatz.com.
